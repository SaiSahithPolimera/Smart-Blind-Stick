### What is this?

The main objective of this project is to provide a sound based
assistance to blind people. Here we to developed a system that
helps blind person to travel independently. This
proposed device is used for guiding individuals who are blind or partially
sighted. The device used to help blind people to move with the same ease
as a sighted people.

## Features:

- **Obstacle detection**- It uses Ultra-sonic sensor to detect the distance between the user and an obstacle and alerts the user by producing buzzer beeps, when the obstacle is too close to the user the beep count increases and produce an alarming sensation.
- **Emergency alert**- This project sends the live location of the stick user to the specified mobile number of the family member so that they can track them at during the emergency.

### Hardware used:

- Hardware Requirement:
- Arduino UNO R3
- Ultra-sonic sensor
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- GPS Module
- GSM Module
- HW Batteries(9V)
- Pencil Batteries (1.5V)
- HW Connectors
- Pencil Battery Holders
- Switches

### Software used:

- Arduino IDE (Version 1.8.57.0)

### Languages used:

The code is written in a simplified version of C++ with some elements of C.

### Libraries used:

- **TinyGPS++:** TinyGPS++ is a arduino library for parsing NMEA data streams provided by GPS modules.
- **Software Serial library:** The SoftwareSerial library allows serial communication on other digital pins of an Arduino board, using software to replicate the functionality
- **LiquidCrystal:** A library that provides a simple and intuitive interface for controlling LCD displays.
